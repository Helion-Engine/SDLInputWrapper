# Managed wrapper for SDL Controllers
This is a managed wrapper and P/Invoke bindings for game controller functionality exposed in libSDL2.

To use this wrapper, you will either need to build libSDL2 from source and include the native .dll/.so file in your output directory, or use the precompiled versions available in this project's source repository: https://github.com/Helion-Engine/SDLInputWrapper.  Please see the repository for a simple "demo" program which uses this library to poll a controller connected to your computer.
